Create a luxury feeling high-end SaaS web application, as if you were a senior website designer and software engineer working with startups for an AI-powered Full-Service content creation and marketing app called TACE (Topical Authority Content Engine). This SaaS web application will have a Frontend, and a Backend. The Backend will be gated and will stroe user accounts and content in a PostgreSQL database. Do the application Frontend website design to match the style of this site: 'https://ai-content-template.webflow.io/'. I want the website to feature the following pages: Homepage, About page, contact us page, a blog page with 4 blog articles already populated. The nav menu should also have a Register button for none registered users.

For the homepage I want it to include a hero section with a title, copy, and get started button centred, with a large image underneath showing the product UI using the attached image ‘mockup’. 

I want the homepage to then feature a:

- Featured in section, showing logos of publications this app has been in
- Testomonials section with a scrolling carousel of testimonials, each testimonial should also have the result that the user got
- How it works section with 3 cards for chose your AI, set up your AI assistant, automate your content creation, publication and promotion. 

Each card should have an image on as well

- Features section with a grid of 4 cards showing the features of the app, with icons on each card
- Mission statement section which communicates the mission of the company and why we built the app
- Pricing section with plans for free, pro and enterprise level plans, with a description on each as well as benefit bullet points and a recommeded badge on the pro plan
- FAQ section with some questions
- Footer

The website should also have a top navigation with only anchor links to all the sections on the homepage, and not link to any other page. The top navigation should also be sticky and blur the background behind it when you scroll.


Style wise, I want to use Inter as the font, with a light font weight for all text and tight letter spacing for headings. Any text that isn't headings should have a lower opacity. I want to use phosphor icons for the icon library with the light icon weight for all icons.


When a page loads the content should animate in from 0 opacity to 100 opacity and animate up. Also animate all the sections and components with opacity and blur as the user scrolls down the page.


For button styles I want to use a neumorphism 3d style button that glows when you hover. Any cards on the page should have a glassmorphic style with background blur and low opacity.


From the tablet breakpoint down, the navigation menu should collapse to a burger menu, with an animating full height tray style menu coming in from the right and animating out when it is closed.


For the Backend the application should have the following fully functional Modules:
